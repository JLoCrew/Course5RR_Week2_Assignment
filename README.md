# Course5RR_Week2_Assignment
R markdown code for Week 2 Assignment

The data is collected from a portable device that tracked the subject's movement from Oct to Nov 2012.

The data was kept largely intact with the exception of few transformations:
a) a new variable called "weekend_weekday" was added to classify the observations as either "weekend" or "weekday"
b) missing values (denoted as "NA") were appended by taking the mean value from the same 5-min interval from other days. This was done for the later part of the assignment.  The missing values were omitted for first half of the assignment
